</div>

## Getting Started

The Topos Playground is a CLI that allows you to easily run and manage a local Topos devnet. It depends on Docker and NodeJS, and manages a number of components in order to locally run multiple subnets, multiple TCE nodes, and a dApp with supporting infrastructure, capable of cross-subnet messaging.

### Requirements

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/_) version 17.06.0 or greater
- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.dev/en/) version 16.0.0 or greater
- Git

### Install / Run topos-playground

Depending on your NodeJS environment and preferences, there are several ways to install the Topos Playground.

To install the playground globally, using `npm`, run the following command:

```
$ npm install -g @topos-protocol/topos-playground
```

To install the playground globally, using `yarn`, run the following command:

```
$ yarn global add @topos-protocol/topos-playground
```

Alternatively, you can install and run via `npx`:

```
$ npx @topos-protocol/topos-playground
```

#### Install via Git

If you prefer to install the playground via Git, you can clone the repository and install it manually.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/topos-protocol/topos-playground.git
$ cd topos-playground
$ npm install
$ npm run build && npm link
```

### Run the CLI

If you have installed the via `npm` or `yarn`, you can run the CLI like any other command line tool:

```
$ topos-playground --help
```

If you are using `npx`, you will run it via `npx`:

```
$ npx @topos-protocol/topos-playground --help
```

Topos Playground supports two subcommands, `start` and `clean`.

```
$ topos-playground start
```

This will check that the required prerequisites are met, and will then setup and start all of the containers for a complete local Topos network. It will report progress to the console as well as logging to a file.

```
$ topos-playground clean
```

To clean up any still-running docker containers or filesystem artifacts from a previous invocation of the topos-playground, use the `clean` command.

The playground respects XDG Base Directory Specifications, so by default, it will store
data used while running in `$HOME/.local/share/topos-playground` and it will store logs
in `$HOME/.state/topos-playground/logs`.

To override these default locations, you can set your `HOME`, `XDG_DATA_HOME` and `XDG_STATE_HOME`
environment variables, or specify them in a `.env` file.

```
$ HOME=/tmp topos-playground start
```

By default, topos-playground sends output to both your console and to a log file when it is running.
To disable this, you can use the `--quiet` flag to prevent output from going to the console, or the
`--no-log` flag to prevent output from going to the log file.

```
$ topos-playground clean --quiet
```

### Development

To contribute to the development of the playground, [fork](https://github.com/topos-protocol/topos-playground/fork) the repository.

Do your work within a branch on your fork. When it is ready, create a Pull Request that clearly explains the reasoning behind your code changes, what they do, and anything that we should be aware of when testing your code.

### Discussion

For community help or discussion, you can join the Topos Discord server:

### Troubleshooting

* `Running the redis server...‚ùó Error`

The container that provides the Redis service was unable to start. This is likely because you are already running a Redis instance on your system. Try shutting it down.

On Linux:

```
$ sudo systemctl stop redis-server
```

or


```
$ sudo service redis-server stop
```

On MacOS:

```
brew services stop redis
```

If you manually installed and started Redis, you will need to manually stop it.

```
$ redis-cli shutdown
```

* `Error: failed to create network local-erc20-messaging-infra-docker: Error response from daemon: could not find an available, non-overlapping IPv4 address pool among the defaults to assign to the network`

The likely cause of this error is that you are running a VPN of some sort.

The quick fix for this is to shut down your VPN, and then try to run the playground again.

* `Error: Error response from daemon: driver failed programming external connectivity on endpoint infra-tce-boot-1 (145130455efa244316eb0570064adb584e2c99d18fa2cd8f58b2774f1144d2bb):  (iptables failed: iptables --wait -t nat -A DOCKER -p tcp -d 0/0 --dport 32807 -j DNAT --to-destination 172.21.0.9:9090 ! -i br-de97b637b33b: iptables v1.8.7 (nf_tables): unknown option "--to-destination"`

If this error occurs, you are running Linux, and you have recently done an OS upgrade, try rebooting your system. If the problem persists, first ensure that you can load the 'xt_nat' kernel module:

```
$ sudo modprobe xt_nat
```

If that command fails, then this is likely the problem. You can try to load the module manually:

```
$ sudo insmod /lib/modules/$(uname -r)/kernel/net/netfilter/xt_nat.ko
```

And then try again.

If that command succeeds, but the problem persists, check your iptables version:

```
$ iptables --version
```

It should show something like this:

```
iptables v1.8.7 (nf_tables)
```

If the `nf_tables` is absent, and you have already tried to reboot, investigate your `/usr/sbin/iptables` symlink. It should point to `/usr/sbin/xtables-nft-multi`. It should, either via a direct link, or perhaps through a chain of symlinks, point to `/usr/sbin/xtables-nft-multi`.
